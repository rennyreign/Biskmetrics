   - Real-time visibility into program performance 24/7

2. **Cost Savings:** Identify underperforming programs faster
   - Stop spending on failing programs within 30 days (vs. months of waste)
   - $20K validation cap prevents over-investment in unproven programs
   - Estimated savings: **$100K-$300K annually** in redirected marketing spend

3. **Accountability:** Automated pass/fail recommendations
   - Remove subjectivity from program prioritization
   - Data-driven shelf allocation based on actual pipeline performance

4. **Efficiency:** Eliminate manual reporting
   - Weekly digests auto-generated and emailed
   - Quarterly reviews prepared automatically
   - Estimated time savings: **20-30 hours/month** for marketing ops team

5. **Transparency:** School partners see their own performance
   - Self-service access reduces "where do we stand?" meetings
