# Intent

## Why
- Document known limitations and temporary waivers for Phase 2+3
- Ensure hermetic compliance transparency
- Track technical debt with clear resolution plans

## What changed
- Added docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md with comprehensive limitation tracking
- Updated .windsurf/rules/hermetic-engineering.md with temporary waiver section
- Documented placeholder spend data, legacy file exclusions, ESLint warnings
- Set expiration date (2026-03-31) for all waivers

## Risks / Tradeoffs
- None - pure documentation changes
- Improves transparency and accountability

## Rollback plan
- Simple revert if documentation is incorrect
- No code changes, zero risk
