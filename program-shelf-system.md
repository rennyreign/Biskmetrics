# The Program Shelf System

**A Performance-Led Approach to Program Prioritization**

### Overview

The **Program Shelf System** is Bisk’s operating framework for determining which programs we actively market, prioritize, and invest in.

Similar to how a supermarket allocates shelf space, programs are not promoted by default or based on legacy assumptions. Instead, **each program must earn and maintain its place through measurable performance**. Shelf space—attention, spend, and operational focus—is finite and allocated to programs that demonstrably create value.

### How the System Works

The Program Shelf System operates as a **continuous lifecycle** with two primary stages:

### **Stage 1: Market Validation (Entry Gate)**

New or unproven programs must first demonstrate pipeline integrity before earning active shelf placement.

### **Stage 2: Ongoing Performance Management (Shelf Optimization)**

Programs that pass validation compete continuously for priority based on current performance.

## Stage 1: Market Validation Protocol

**Purpose:** Determine whether a program has sufficient market and pipeline integrity to justify ongoing marketing investment.

### Validation Parameters

- **Investment Cap:** $20,000
- **Test Window:** 30 days
- **Objective:** Validate real pipeline performance under constrained, repeatable conditions

This stage is designed to surface structural weaknesses early, before capital and operational effort compound.

### Pipeline Benchmarks

Programs are evaluated across three mandatory performance thresholds:

1. **Inquiry → Opportunity**
    - Minimum **10% conversion rate**
2. **Opportunity → Application / Enrollment**
    - Minimum **15% conversion**
    - *(Application for degrees, enrollment for certificates)*
3. **Application → Enrollment**
    - Minimum **15% conversion rate**

Each benchmark reflects a distinct aspect of program viability: demand quality, sales feasibility, and student commitment.

### Pass / Fail Rule

- A program must meet **at least 2 of the 3 criteria** to pass validation
- If a program **fails 2 or more criteria**, paid marketing is discontinued
- The program does **not progress to Stage 2**

**Decisions are binary and data-driven to maintain system integrity.**

### Outcome

- **Pass:** Program graduates to Stage 2 (active shelf placement with ongoing performance management)
- **Fail:** Program is removed from paid promotion and may be revisited only if material changes occur (pricing, positioning, modality, admissions structure)

## Stage 2: Ongoing Performance Management

**Purpose:** Continuously optimize shelf allocation based on comparative program performance.

### Standardized Performance Criteria

All validated programs are evaluated against a consistent set of performance indicators:

- Lead efficiency and conversion
- Cost per acquisition
- Revenue contribution
- Operational viability
- Market responsiveness and demand signals

This ensures decisions are **data-led, not subjective**.

### Quarterly Performance Reviews

Program performance is reviewed **quarterly** following a three-step process:

1. **Performance Assessment**
    
    Data is analyzed against standardized criteria to determine program standing
    
2. **Presentation to Leadership**
    
    Findings and recommendations are reviewed with leadership for decision-making
    
3. **Communication to Partners**
    
    Decisions are communicated to relevant partners and stakeholders
    

Each review determines whether a program:

- Retains its shelf position
- Earns increased prioritization
- Is deprioritized or rotated out

### Dynamic Shelf Allocation

Shelf space is not permanent.

Programs compete continuously for priority based on current performance, allowing Bisk to:

- Respond quickly to market shifts
- Reduce waste and inefficiency
- Focus effort where it produces the highest return

### Real-Time Performance Visibility

Decisions are informed by a **program performance dashboard** that provides ongoing insight into outcomes, trends, and comparative performance across programs.

## System Principles

- **No program is guaranteed promotion.**
- **No program is immune to review.**
- **Legacy status does not outweigh current performance.**

Programs succeed or fail based on their ability to perform in-market—not on intent, effort, or historical precedence.

---

## Why This Matters

The Program Shelf System allows Bisk to:

- Allocate marketing investment responsibly
- Avoid over-supporting low-value programs
- Create fairness and transparency in decision-making
- Scale efficiently without relying on excessive promotion

Ultimately, this approach aligns resources with real demand, ensuring that **Bisk markets what works—and only what works**.
