## Blockers (Must Fix)
- `diff.patch` (`src/hooks/useScorecardData.ts`): `addMetric()` writes new metrics into `metricsState`, but `metrics` is built only from `DEGREE_METRICS` / `CERTIFICATE_METRICS`. Custom metrics are never appended, so “Add Metric” still does not actually add visible/persisted rows.
- `diff.patch` (`src/hooks/useScorecardData.ts`): `calculateMetricData()` still uses `Math.random()` for streak/IDS fields during render-time computation, making scorecard output nondeterministic across rerenders.

## Should Fix
- `diff.patch` (`src/hooks/useScorecardData.ts`): `_weekKey` remains unused, so week navigation in `ScorecardPage` changes dates in UI but not underlying data.
- `diff.patch` (`src/pages/ScorecardPage.tsx`): ID generation via `custom-${Date.now()}` is collision-prone under rapid adds; use a safer unique ID strategy.

## Nice to Have
- `diff.patch` (`src/components/Scorecard/AddMetricDialog.tsx`): consider validating/normalizing numeric target input (NaN/negative/empty edge cases) before enabling save.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- `ci.txt` shows tests pass (`42/42`), but coverage is only existing unit suites; no tests are shown for new scorecard flows (`useScorecardData`, add-metric path, dialog state sync).
- Add focused tests for:
  - add-metric end-to-end in hook/component integration
  - edit-dialog resync behavior when switching metrics
  - deterministic streak/IDS behavior

## Security Notes
- No direct security-critical changes identified in the reviewed delta.
- No secret leakage observed in the four reviewed bundle files.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- `ci.txt` indicates reproducible quality checks were run and passed for format/type/test, but lint still reports `30 warnings` (waived policy appears documented in `diff.patch` changes to hermetic rules).
- `status.txt` confirms broad staged scope outside this bundle; this review is limited to the bundle files as requested.
