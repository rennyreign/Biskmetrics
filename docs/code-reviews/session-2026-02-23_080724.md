## Blockers (Must Fix)
- `package.json` uses wildcard dependency ranges (`"@mui/material": "*"`, `"clsx": "*"`, `"tailwind-merge": "*"`) while intent claims hermetic version pinning. Replace `*` with explicit versions to keep dependency resolution deterministic when lockfiles are regenerated.

## Should Fix
- `tsconfig.json` includes only `"src"`, so `tests/**/*.ts` are not typechecked by `npm run typecheck`. Include test files (or add a dedicated `tsconfig.test.json`) to catch typing regressions in tests.
- `scripts/setup.sh` checks only for Node presence, not the required pinned version (`24.11.1`). Add an explicit version guard for hermetic setup.
- `package.json` `quality` script does not enforce coverage or coverage thresholds, despite intent/README claims around coverage quality.

## Nice to Have
- Resolve current lint warnings noted in `ci.txt` (especially `no-explicit-any` in `src/lib/dataQuality.ts` and test files) to reduce drift from stricter standards.
- Align documentation claims in `README.md` (e.g., critical-path coverage guarantees) with enforced CI checks to avoid overstatement.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- `ci.txt` shows `29` tests passing across `2` test files.
- Coverage is not reported in CI run (`npm run quality` runs `npm run test`, not `npm run test:coverage`), so coverage claims are currently unverified in pipeline output.

## Security Notes
- No obvious secret leakage in `.env.example`; HubSpot keys are placeholders.
- Security audit exists (`scripts/audit-deps.sh`) but is not part of `quality`/pre-commit default flow, so vulnerable dependency detection is not continuously enforced.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- Positive: lockfile committed, Node version files present (`.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`), reproducible install command (`npm ci`) used in setup.
- Gap: wildcard dependency specs in `package.json` conflict with hermetic pinning goals.
- Gap: toolchain version is documented but not strictly enforced by setup scripts.
