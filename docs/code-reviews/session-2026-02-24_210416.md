## Blockers (Must Fix)
- `src/components/Scorecard/EditMetricDialog.tsx`: local form state is initialized once from `metric` and never resynced when `metric` changes. First open (and metric-to-metric switches) can show stale/empty values, causing incorrect edits.
- `src/pages/ScorecardPage.tsx`: `handleAddMetric` is a no-op (`console.log` + close). UI presents “Add Metric” as functional, but no metric is added or persisted.

## Should Fix
- `src/hooks/useScorecardData.ts`: `Math.random()` is used for streak/IDS flags during render-time calculation, making scorecard state nondeterministic and unstable across rerenders.
- `src/hooks/useScorecardData.ts`: `_weekKey` is ignored, so week navigation in `ScorecardPage` changes labels but not data.
- `ci.txt`: lint has 32 warnings (including new scorecard files), so quality bar is passing with known debt rather than clean.

## Nice to Have
- `src/components/Scorecard/MetricTable.tsx`: clickable `<tr>` rows are mouse-centric; add keyboard/accessibility semantics for row activation.
- `src/pages/ScorecardPage.tsx`: remove unused `Button` import and `any` in `handleAddMetric` for cleaner typing/lint posture.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- CI is green: `format`, `lint` (warnings only), `typecheck`, and 42 tests passed.
- No tests cover newly introduced scorecard/UI paths (`useScorecardData`, `ScorecardPage`, dialogs, table interactions).
- Missing regression tests for the stated target-status recalculation behavior after edits.

## Security Notes
- No obvious secret exposure or injection issues observed in bundle content.
- `console.log('Adding new metric:', newMetric)` may leak operational data in shared browser logs; remove or gate for production.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- Build/test reproducibility evidence is present (`npm run quality` output recorded).
- Lint cleanliness is not hermetic-clean (32 warnings), and waiver accounting appears drifted versus current warning count.
- Bundle includes extensive non-product artifacts in the staged diff context, increasing review surface and reducing deterministic change isolation.
