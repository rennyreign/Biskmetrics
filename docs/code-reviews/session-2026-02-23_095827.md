## Blockers (Must Fix)
- `ci.txt`: CI is failing (`npm run quality` exits at `prettier --check` with 4 files). This must be green before merge.
- `diff.patch` (`tsconfig.json` hunk near `diff.patch:4750`): `include` was narrowed to only `src/lib/**/*`, `src/types/**/*`, `src/providers/**/*`, `tests/**/*`, which excludes `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/**/*`, and `src/data/programs.ts`. This weakens typecheck coverage and can hide breakages in exactly the files changed here.
- `diff.patch` (`src/data/programs.ts` migration hunk near `diff.patch:4338`): migrated funnel data contains impossible values (`inquiries: 12`, `opportunities: 14`, conversion `116.7%`). This is a data integrity defect in production-facing metrics.
- `diff.patch` (`scripts/migrate-programs.cjs` and `src/data/programs.ts` hunks): migration logic uses `||` fallbacks for numeric rates, which converts valid `0.0` values to `null` (seen repeatedly in converted records). This silently corrupts KPI semantics.

## Should Fix
- `diff.patch` (`src/App.tsx`): `loading` state is set but not used in UI, so users get no loading/error UX despite async fetch path.
- `diff.patch` (`src/providers/DataProvider.interface.ts`): interface contract was changed (removed methods, renamed methods). Verify all consumers/adapters are updated and covered, since current tsconfig scope may not catch misses.

## Nice to Have
- `diff.patch` (`scripts/migrate-programs.cjs`): add invariant checks in migration output (e.g., `opportunities <= inquiries`, rates in `[0,100]` unless explicitly allowed) to prevent future bad dataset commits.
- `diff.patch` (`src/components/ProgramTable.tsx`): add explicit empty-state text for missing ROI/recommendation fields beyond a dash to improve interpretability.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- Added provider unit tests are good (`tests/unit/FixedDataProvider.test.ts`), but gaps remain:
- No tests for `ProgramTable` nested sorting/formatting (`roi.*`, `conversions.*`) and badge rendering.
- No tests validating migrated dataset invariants (non-negative, monotonic funnel, sane conversion bounds).
- No integration test covering `App.tsx` async load/error/loading behavior.

## Security Notes
- `diff.patch` (`package.json` / `package-lock.json`): added `@tailwindcss/postcss` stack pulls native optional binaries (`@tailwindcss/oxide*`, `lightningcss*`). Keep lockfile pinned and CI/runtime Node version aligned to avoid supply-chain/runtime drift.
- No direct secrets/auth boundary changes detected in the reviewed bundle files.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- `ci.txt`: build is not hermetic-ready while quality gate is failing.
- `status.txt`: worktree is not clean (many unstaged/untracked files), increasing risk of accidental inclusion or non-reproducible review state.
- `diff.patch` (`tsconfig.json`): reduced typecheck scope violates the intent of comprehensive deterministic verification for touched app code.
