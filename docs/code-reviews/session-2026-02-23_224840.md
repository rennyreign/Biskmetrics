## Blockers (Must Fix)
- The waiver justification says all 27 ESLint warnings are in legacy code and test files, but `ci.txt` shows warnings in active files like `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/RecommendedVerdict.tsx`. Update the waiver language in `.windsurf/rules/hermetic-engineering.md` and/or the categories in `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` to reflect the actual warning locations and scope.

## Should Fix
- The “Non-Waived” section claims “zero TypeScript errors in active code” but doesn’t define what “active code” means or how it’s enforced. Add a short definition or pointer to the actual exclusion mechanism in `.windsurf/rules/hermetic-engineering.md`.

## Nice to Have
- In `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`, clarify whether “Phase 4 cleanup” is a date-bound commitment or an estimate so the waiver expiration (2026-03-31) and remediation timelines read consistently.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- `ci.txt` shows tests ran and passed (42/42). ESLint warnings exist (27 total) and are explicitly waived.

## Security Notes
- No security-impacting changes observed (documentation-only).

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- Waivers are time-boxed to 2026-03-31 and documented. Ensure the waiver scope matches actual CI output to maintain hermetic compliance integrity.
