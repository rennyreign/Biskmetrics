Blockers (Must Fix): 0

## Should Fix
- Add/extend unit tests in `diff.patch` scope (`src/hooks/useScorecardData.ts`) to assert that changing `target` recomputes `status`, `greenStreak`, `redStreak`, and `idsFlagged` together (this is the core regression being fixed, but no targeted test evidence is shown in `ci.txt`).
- Add input guards for edited numeric targets (reject/normalize `0`, negative, `NaN`) to avoid divide-by-zero/invalid-status paths in status recalculation logic.

## Nice to Have
- Consolidate duplicated status/derived-field recomputation into one shared helper to reduce drift risk between initial calculation and post-edit recalculation.
- Document expected IDS/streak behavior in code comments or brief developer docs so future edits preserve invariants.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- `ci.txt` shows quality checks passed (format/lint/typecheck/test) with `42/42` tests passing.
- No explicit test output indicates coverage of the target-edit recalculation path; this remains a regression-risk area.

## Security Notes
- No new direct security issue is visible in the reviewed bundle files.
- IDS notes/hypothesis/action fields appear to be plain text workflow fields; continue to treat as untrusted input at render/persistence boundaries.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- `ci.txt` reports lint warnings (`30` warnings, `0` errors). This is non-blocking per waiver pattern, but should stay explicitly tracked.
- `status.txt` is broad (repo-wide status snapshot), so bundle-level traceability is less hermetic than ideal; consider narrowing status output to this bundle’s effective scope in future bundles.
