## Blockers (Must Fix)
- Data corruption introduced in migrated dataset: `NaN` literals are written into numeric fields (for example `contactToApplicationRate`, and one record with `opportunities/applications/enrollments` all `NaN`), which will poison sorting, charting, and ROI math. See `diff.patch:3772`, `diff.patch:5194`, `diff.patch:5204`, `diff.patch:5547`.
- Migration logic is producing incorrect values versus source data (example: `contactToEnrollmentRate` changed from `8.6` to `5.3` in the same record), indicating parsing/mapping is not trustworthy. See `diff.patch:6038`, `diff.patch:6059`.
- Type-check scope was reduced by excluding large code areas (`src/components/ui/**/*`, `src/data/mockData.ts`), so “typecheck passing” no longer validates the full bundle surface. See `diff.patch:6427`.

## Should Fix
- `npm run lint` still reports 27 warnings, including `any` in sorting/rendering paths and unused imports/state in changed files, so quality signal is degraded. See `ci.txt`.
- `App.tsx` introduces `loading` state but does not use it for rendering; this can produce empty/flash states and dead code. See `diff.patch:1089`.
- Migration script is brittle (line-based parsing with `if (i < 13) continue` and regex value extraction), making repeatable migrations fragile. See `diff.patch:932`, `diff.patch:960`, `diff.patch:1041`.

## Nice to Have
- Add explicit validation pass after migration to enforce finite numeric metrics and fail fast on `NaN`.
- Replace `as any` nested field access in table sorting/rendering with typed accessors to avoid silent runtime issues.
- Surface a loading UI path in dashboard views to match new async data-provider flow.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- Current tests pass (`42/42`), but they do not assert data integrity constraints like “all numeric metric fields are finite” across `programs.ts`. See `ci.txt`.
- No tests cover migration-script correctness (schema transform fidelity and null/0.0 preservation), which is where the critical data defects were introduced.

## Security Notes
- No direct secret exposure or auth-risk changes detected in this bundle.
- Main risk is integrity: corrupted numeric data (`NaN`) can propagate into decision outputs and analytics.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- Hermetic quality claim is weakened by narrowing TypeScript coverage via `tsconfig` excludes (`diff.patch:6427`).
- `getScorecardMetrics()` defaults to `new Date()` when omitted, introducing time-based nondeterminism in outputs. See `diff.patch:6224`.
- Migration reproducibility is not hermetic due to format-sensitive parsing assumptions (`diff.patch:960`).
