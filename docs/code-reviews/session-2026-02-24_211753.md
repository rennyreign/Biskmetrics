## Blockers (Must Fix)
- `useScorecardData` recalculates `status` after target edits but does not recalculate `greenStreak`/`redStreak`/`idsFlagged`. This can produce contradictory state (for example, `status: green` while still IDS-flagged red). Recompute all derived fields together whenever editable inputs affecting status change.

## Should Fix
- Week navigation is still effectively visual-only: `_weekKey` is accepted but unused in data generation, so changing week does not change scorecard values.
- Custom metrics are appended unsorted; they can violate expected `sortOrder` grouping/order behavior.
- Hermetic waiver text and CI evidence are out of sync (waiver describes 27 warnings, CI shows 30), so compliance documentation is stale.

## Nice to Have
- Replace `Date.now()`-based custom metric IDs with a more collision-resistant deterministic strategy (small risk, but cleaner).
- Add explicit UX copy that scorecard data is mock/static by week until backend integration is complete.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- `npm run quality` passes format/type/test; `vitest` is 42/42.
- No test evidence for new scorecard flows (`add metric`, `edit metric`, IDS/streak recalculation, week navigation semantics). Add unit tests for `useScorecardData` and at least one integration test for dialog-driven updates.

## Security Notes
- No direct secret handling or injection issues identified from the bundle evidence.
- Current deterministic streak hash is non-cryptographic, which is acceptable for mock/UI-only behavior.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- Lint is not clean (`30` warnings), and warnings include active/new code paths.
- Compliance rule updates were made, but waiver counts no longer match CI output; update the waiver ledger to current reality and track a burn-down plan.
