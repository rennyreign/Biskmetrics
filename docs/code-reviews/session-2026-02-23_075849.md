## Blockers (Must Fix)
- `npm run quality` is red due TypeScript compile failures, so this bundle is not merge-ready (`ci.txt:53`, `ci.txt:156`).  
  Action: fix all `tsc --noEmit` errors before re-running quality gates.
- `Program` type migration is incomplete: new `Program` shape in `src/types/program.ts` conflicts with existing data usage (`diff.patch:1548`, `ci.txt:133`).  
  Action: update data producers/consumers (notably `src/data/mockData.ts`) to the new `conversions`/`funnel` model or provide backward-compatible typing.
- `package.json` changed but `package-lock.json` is not staged (`status.txt:17`, `status.txt:39`), which breaks hermetic/reproducible install state for the reviewed change set.  
  Action: include the lockfile update in the same bundle.

## Should Fix
- Lint warnings remain (15 total), including `no-unused-vars` and `no-explicit-any` (`ci.txt:17`, `ci.txt:50`).  
  Action: clear warnings or explicitly document/waive them in policy.
- CI evidence is polluted by a large unstaged working tree (`status.txt:36` onward), making attribution to staged changes unclear.  
  Action: re-run CI from a clean tree containing only intended changes.

## Nice to Have
- Narrow permissive dependency ranges (`*`) in `package.json` for tighter dependency control (`diff.patch:798`, `diff.patch:826`, `diff.patch:840`).
- Align setup script to run the same top-level gate (`npm run quality`) for consistency with CI (`diff.patch:795`, `diff.patch:963`).

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- New unit tests were added for metrics/recommendation engines (`diff.patch:1714`, `diff.patch:1882`), but they did not execute because the pipeline stops at typecheck (`ci.txt:53`).
- Coverage claims are not validated by this run.

## Security Notes
- `.env.example` documents `VITE_HUBSPOT_API_KEY` (`diff.patch:11`). `VITE_` variables are client-exposed in Vite builds.  
  Action: ensure API keys are never used from frontend runtime; route sensitive HubSpot access through a backend/service token flow.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- Positive: runtime/tooling version pinning added via `.nvmrc` and `.tool-versions` (`diff.patch:21`, `diff.patch:27`).
- Gaps: lockfile not included with dependency changes (`status.txt:17`, `status.txt:39`) and wildcard dependency specs reduce determinism (`diff.patch:798`, `diff.patch:826`, `diff.patch:840`).
