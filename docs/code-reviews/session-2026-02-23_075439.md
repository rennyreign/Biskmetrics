## Blockers (Must Fix)
- `ci.txt`: `npm run quality` fails at `npm run typecheck` with many `TS2307` module resolution errors, so the quality gate is currently red and this bundle is not merge-ready.
- `ci.txt` + `diff.patch`: path alias imports (`@/...`) were added in new files, but TypeScript cannot resolve them (`Cannot find module '@/types/...')`; align `tsconfig`/Vite/ESLint path mapping so typecheck passes.
- `ci.txt`: UI imports are being resolved as version-suffixed module names (e.g., `@radix-ui/react-accordion@1.2.3`, `lucide-react@0.487.0`), which is invalid for TS module resolution; normalize import specifiers to package names only.
- `ci.txt`: `src/data/mockData.ts` now violates the new `Program` type (`inquiryToEnrollmentRate` unknown property) across many entries; reconcile schema change or update data shape.

## Should Fix
- `diff.patch` (`package.json`): `quality` claims full gate, but it blocks tests when typecheck fails; keep this behavior, but update docs to clearly state tests may not run if earlier gates fail.
- `ci.txt`: lint has 15 warnings (`no-explicit-any`, unused import, react-refresh export warnings). Not blocking now, but these should be reduced before expanding strictness.
- `intent.md`: claims “>80% coverage on critical paths,” but this run has no coverage output due typecheck failure; adjust claims or ensure a successful coverage run is captured.

## Nice to Have
- `diff.patch` (`scripts/*.sh`): add non-interactive, CI-friendly flags/logging (for example explicit failure summaries) to make pipeline diagnosis faster.
- `README.md`/`docs/AGENTS.md`: remove or defer feature claims that are not validated in this bundle’s passing CI state.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- `ci.txt`: formatting and lint execute; `typecheck` fails; test phase does not run.
- New unit tests are present in `diff.patch` (`tests/unit/metricsEngine.test.ts`, `tests/unit/recommendationEngine.test.ts`), but there is no evidence in `ci.txt` that they passed in this bundle.
- No coverage artifact/result is shown in `ci.txt`, so coverage assertions are unverified for this change set.

## Security Notes
- `intent.md` reports 19 `npm audit` vulnerabilities (dev dependencies, marked non-blocking). Track with owner/date and define acceptable severity threshold for release.
- `.env.example` in `diff.patch` is appropriately non-secret and commented; no direct secret leakage observed in reviewed bundle files.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- `diff.patch` (`package.json`): multiple dependency ranges use `^` and `*`; this weakens hermetic reproducibility despite lockfile usage.
- `diff.patch` (`.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`) pins Node version, which is good; however, dependency pinning policy is inconsistent with “hermetic” claims in `intent.md`/`README.md`.
- Current state is not hermetically verifiable because the declared quality gate does not pass (`ci.txt`).
