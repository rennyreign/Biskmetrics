## Blockers (Must Fix)
- `src/data/programs.ts` uses synthesized spend values (`totalSpend = leads * 50`) via migration logic in `scripts/migrate-programs.cjs`; ROI/CPL/CPE and budget recommendations are therefore based on placeholder spend, not real spend. Gate recommendation features behind verified spend inputs or mark ROI/recommendation outputs as non-production until real spend is loaded.
- Hermetic quality gate mismatch: `.windsurf/rules/hermetic-engineering.md` declares `zero_lint_warnings: true`, but `ci.txt` shows 27 ESLint warnings and still passes. Align CI enforcement with declared hermetic policy or relax the policy text explicitly.

## Should Fix
- `tsconfig.json` excludes `src/components/ui/**/*` and `src/data/mockData.ts`, reducing effective type-safety coverage while intent claims broader stabilization. Track this as dated technical debt with a concrete cleanup milestone.
- `src/components/GraphView.tsx` scoring formula changed to `volume 30% + enroll 70%`, but on-screen explanatory copy still describes the old 20/35/45 model. Update labels to prevent misleading analytics interpretation.
- `src/App.tsx` introduces `loading` state but does not render loading/error UI, causing silent failures on provider errors.

## Nice to Have
- Replace hard-coded filter option lists in `src/components/FilterSection.tsx` with provider-backed `getSchools()`/`getLevels()` to avoid drift from source data.
- Add deterministic tests around provider freshness behavior (`refresh`) and scorecard date defaults.

## Tests / Coverage Notes
- `ci.txt` shows `npm run quality` completed with passing format/typecheck/tests and 42 passing tests.
- No evidence in `ci.txt` of migration-specific regression tests (e.g., NaN prevention, fallback enrollment-rate edge cases) despite those being key intent claims.
- Lint warnings are present and currently non-failing, so “green CI” does not mean clean quality gates.

## Security Notes
- No obvious secret leakage in reviewed artifacts.
- Main risk is decision integrity: synthetic spend feeding recommendation logic can drive incorrect operational/budget decisions.

## Hermetic Compliance Notes
- Bundle discipline is good (intent + staged diff + CI evidence provided).
- Not hermetic-compliant with its own declared rule set yet: lint warning tolerance and typecheck exclusions create policy-vs-enforcement drift.
- If this is a phased exception, document it as an explicit temporary waiver with owner + target removal date.
